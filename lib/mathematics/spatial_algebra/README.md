spatial_algebra
---------------

This is a simple mathematics library for the usual "spatial algebra" objects used in 3D graphics
and game programming:
    vec3: 3-dimensional vectors.
    vec4: 4-dimensional vectors (Usually homogeneous coordinates for transformation by 4x4 matrices. Can also be used for RGBA colors).
    Quaternions: Used primarily as unit quaternions for representing 3D rotations.
    mat3x3: Used primarily as orientation matrices.
    mat4x4: Used for rigid transforms, affine transforms, and projective transforms (e.g. for camera projections).
