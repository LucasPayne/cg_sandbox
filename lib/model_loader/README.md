model_loader
------------
This library is for loading models from files into a unified structure, MLModel. This library can also handle
some post-processing directly on the MLModel structure, such as computation of angle-weighted vertex normals.

This is essentially a worse version of a small subset of assimp, which is a good model-loading library.
note: May switch over to assimp anyway.
